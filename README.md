# Unreal Engine Castle Environment
One of my first projects in Unreal Engine, this fantasy castle world focused on several aspects of environment building such as modular design, landscape sculpting and painting, lighting, and foliage. All static meshes and materials used were pre-made.
This is a very basic environment explorer game. I am currently working on adding some UI features, but for now, the instructions for the game are as follows:
1. Download the game folder
2. Run "Castle Explorer.exe"
3. Use WASD to walk and the mouse to look around and explore the environment.
4. Hit escape to close the game.
