# Unreal Engine Castle Environment
One of my first projects in Unreal Engine, this fantasy castle world focused on several aspects of environment building such as modular design, landscape sculpting and painting, lighting, and foliage. All static meshes and materials used were pre-made.

Some files included with the project were too big to add to Github, so you can download it here:

This is a very basic walking simulator made to explore the map I created. I am currently working on adding some UI features, but for now, the instructions for the game are as follows:
1. Download the "Castle Environment" folder
2. Run "CastleEnvironment.exe"
3. Use WASD to walk and the mouse to look around and explore the environment.
4. Hit 'Q' to quit the game.
